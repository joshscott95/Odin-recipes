    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p><strong><em>This is a delicious recipe for some tasty Ramen soup feel free to add all the chilis and siracha
        as needed to get your lips burnin'</em></strong>
    </p>
    <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Olive oil (or avocado oil)</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Fresh ginger</li>
        <li>Chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>Rice vinegar</li>
        <li>Low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>Sriracha or hot chili garlic sauce, like Sambal Oelek</li>
        <li>Shredded carrots</li>
        <li>Shiitake mushrooms (optional)</li>
        <li>Scallions</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Soft-boiled egg </li> 

        </ul>
        <ul><strong>Steps</strong>
            <li>Heat sesame oil and olive oil in a medium-large saucepan over moderate heat (see notes).
                 Add garlic and ginger, and simmer until fragrant, 
                about 2-3 minutes. Do not brown the garlic, or else you'll get a bitter flavor.</li>
            <li>Add the carrots and mushrooms 
                if you're using them, and simmer until they soften, about a minute, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Add the broth, Sriracha sauce, rice vinegar, and soy sauce. 
                Stir, and bring to a simmer; let it go for about five minutes. 
                Taste, and adjust heat and taste to your liking by adding more Sriracha and soy sauce if needed.</li>
            <li>While the broth simmers, cook the Ramen noodles in a separate pot as per the package's instructions. 
                (You could cook the noodles in the broth directly, but that makes for a messy transfer to a bowl. 
                It's much easier to transfer drained cooked noodles to a bowl and spoon the broth over top.) 
                Once the noodles are tender, drain and rinse under cool water, place into a soup bowl, and set aside.</li>
            <li>When the soup is ready, spoon the broth over the noodles. Allow to cool. 
                At this point, make your soft-boiled egg if you're garnishing with one, 
                and add the rest of your toppings to serve.</li>
            <li><p><h3><em>Making your soft-boiled egg</em></h3></p>Bring water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the egg(s), and let them boil for five minutes. 
                In the meantime, prepare an ice bath in a bowl. 
                Once five minutes are up, 
                remove the egg(s) and dunk them into the ice bath for about a minute to cool them off enough to handle. 
                Then, lightly crack and roll them on a flat surface, peel, slice in half, and place on top of your Ramen.</li>
        
        </ul>
